pycronparse
===========

Simple cron format parser - built as a quick experiment. This is (or should be) inferior to croniter, and was mostly built because of a challenge I faced that I solved inexpertly. Given the predominance of cron formatting throughout the world as the proper way to express times for job processing, I figured I better figure out how it worked in order to do a better job of handling them.
